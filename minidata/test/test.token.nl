363	This method sends out N (for small N) multicast requests. Until the last request is sent out, this method sleeps for 5 seconds after each request is sent. After the last request is sent, this method sleeps for 2 minutes to allow the ResponseListener time to receive and process any multicast responses sent in reply to the multicast requests. Before sending a request, a new multicast request is constructed so that updates can be made to the set of service IDs of the lookup services discovered due to previous requests. <p> After all requests have been sent, and the ResponseListener has been given the appropriate time to receive and process any multicast responses, if there are no more active instances of this thread, this method terminates (interrupts) the ResponseListener. Note that although it is more desirable to have the ResponseListener set a timeout on the server socket (using setSoTimeout) and then simply exit after a period of time in which both the ResponseListener has been idle, and there have been no active Requestor threads, using setSoTimeout in this way can cause random hangs on the Solaris(TM) operating system.

You can use temporary destinations to implement a simple request/reply mechanism. If you create a temporary destination and specify it as the value of the JMSReplyTo message header field when you send a message, the consumer of the message can use the value of the JMSReplyTo field as the destination to which it sends a reply and can also reference the original request by setting the JMSCorrelationID header field of the reply message to the value of the JMSMessageID header field of the request.

2404	Naive Side Effect Tester -- Use a naive side effect analysis even if interprocedural  information is available. If Naive Side Effect Tester is set to true, Busy Code Motion  uses the conservative side effect information provided by the  NaiveSideEffectTester class, even if interprocedural information  about side effects is available.

If Naive Side Effect Tester is set to false and  Soot is in whole program mode, then Busy Code Motion uses the  side effect information provided by the PASideEffectTester  class. PASideEffectTester uses a points-to analysis to determine  which fields and statics may be written or read by a given  statement. If whole program analysis is not performed, naive  side effect information is used regardless of the setting of  Naive Side Effect Tester.

3128	Note that the acknowledge method of Message acknowledges all messages received on that messages session. Message.acknowledge() method: Clarify that the method applies to all consumed messages of the session. Rationale for this change: A possible misinterpretation of the existing Java API documentation for Message.acknowledge assumed that only messages received prior to ?this? message should be acknowledged. The updated Java API documentation statement emphasizes that message acknowledgment is really a session-level activity and that this message is only being used to identify the session in order to acknowledge all messages consumed by the session. The acknowledge method was placed in the message object only to enable easy access to acknowledgment capability within a message listener?s onMessage method. This change aligns the specification and Java API documentation to define Message.acknowledge in the same manner. Method acknowledging the received messages. We iterate over all the Destination names (the m_deliveries hash) and then on each MessageAcks vec we perform the actual write of JMSAckDataEntry to the space, using the info inside each Ack obj. The Ack obj, is an inner class wrapper that holds all the required information for a successful acknowledge.

This name is the prefix of the requested cluster XSL schema file. Using this, we now go and find the Cluster XSL schema. Look for the requested cluster XSL schema file in the ResourceBundle (classpath) under <EAG home dir>/config/schemas/<reqested_schema_name>-cluster-schema.xsl. If it does no find it in the disk (the default) it looks for it in the JSpaces.jar, in same path. if the requested schema file does not exist in the disk config/schemas dir.. In this case we throw exception (which does not interrupt the system load but acts as a warning) NOTE that the <com.gs.home> must be part of the classpath, in this case.
